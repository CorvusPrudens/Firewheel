///
/// In order to be friendlier to ECS's (entity component systems), it is encouraged
/// that any struct deriving this trait be POD (plain ol' data). If you want your
/// audio node to be usable in the Bevy game engine, also derive
/// `bevy_ecs::prelude::Component`. (You can hide this derive behind a feature flag
/// by using `#[cfg_attr(feature = "bevy", derive(bevy_ecs::prelude::Component))]`).
///
/// # Audio Node Lifecycle
///
/// 1. The user constructs the node as POD or from a custom constructor method for
/// that node.
/// 2. The user adds the node to the graph using `FirewheelCtx::add_node`. If the
/// node has any custom configuration, then the user passes that configuration to this
/// method as well. In this method, the Firewheel context calls [`AudioNode::info`] to
/// get information about the node. The node can also store any custom state in the
/// [`AudioNodeInfo`] struct.
/// 3. At this point the user may now call `FirewheelCtx::node_state` and
/// `FirewheelCtx::node_state_mut` to retrieve the node's custom state.
/// 4. If [`AudioNodeInfo::call_update_method`] was set to `true`, then
/// [`AudioNode::update`] will be called every time the Firewheel context updates.
/// The node's custom state is also accessible in this method.
/// 5. When the Firewheel context is ready for the node to start processing data,
/// it calls [`AudioNode::construct_processor`] to retrieve the realtime
/// [`AudioNodeProcessor`] counterpart of the node. This processor counterpart is
/// then sent to the audio thread.
/// 6. The Firewheel processor calls [`AudioNodeProcessor::process`] whenever there
/// is a new block of audio data to process.
/// 7. (Graceful shutdown)
///
///     7a. The Firewheel processor calls [`AudioNodeProcessor::stream_stopped`].
/// The processor is then sent back to the main thread.
///
///     7b. If a new audio stream is started, then the context will call
/// [`AudioNodeProcessor::new_stream`] on the main thread, and then send the
/// processor back to the audio thread for processing.
///
///     7c. If the Firewheel context is dropped before a new stream is started, then
/// both the node and the processor counterpart are dropped.
/// 8. (Audio thread crashes or stops unexpectedly) - The node's processor counterpart
/// may or may not be dropped. The user may try to create a new audio stream, in which
/// case [`AudioNode::construct_processor`] might be called again. If a second processor
/// instance is not able to be created, then the node may panic.
